Thereâ€™s some interesting GPL add ons for blender which make clothing simulation easy. 
A modified version of these add-ons might blow the pants off of CLOBot since the CLO API is so limiting, at least at the time of this writing.

Modular Configurator remains a valuable interface for garment creation, but it seems very possible with add-ons in blender to elevate someone way above what CLOBot is capable of.
