Started at 8:07pm. About 100 garments from blocks and then simulations on avatars to follow. On my Windows VM. CLO 5.2

Yesterday, I found a file name issue that was causing some files to be so long that when truncated on Windows some garments were overwritten in the process. No bueno. 
Fixed this. Also, this is a big test for the script. I may not let it finish but I just would like to see it write a bunch of files without breaking.

As this is working I see in the thumbnails for the garments, there are these blue lines. If these appear in the final renders, maybe tell the CLOBot user to be sure to turn off certain lines.

Currently, on my WindowsVM, alongside macOS, it is spitting out one garment / minute. 

I think it might be worth it for CLOBot to make some folders inside the designated output folder.
For example:
`<Garment Type>/<Garment subcategory>/block name 1 block name 2 block name n. zpac`
Something like that. 
These folders will need to be made outside of CLO before the script is run.

Paused at 8:30.
Resumed at 10pm.
Finished Garments in 10:41pm
108 garments in about 1 hour.

The rendered images are completely black and so is the CLO UI.

Hereâ€™s hoping this is a virtual machine thing. I walk away from my Mac for a bit. 
The nano and mini versions of this code worked fine. Maybe CLO is under stress and maybe its a VM thing; those are my two theories.
